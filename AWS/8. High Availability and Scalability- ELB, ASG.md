# High Availability & Scalability

- vertical scaling - increase instance size
- horizontal scaling - auto scaling group , load balancer
- high availability - auto scaling group multi AZ, load balancer multi AZ

# Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)

- Spread load across multiple downstream instances
- Expose a single point of access [[DNS]] to your application, **it gives you an DNS name while the creation**, in contrast, you **can't attach it with a static elastic IP**
- Failover seamlessly
- Regular health check to your instances
- SSL termination (HTTPS) for your website (==TODO: what is this??==)
- Enforce stickiness with cookies (==TODO: what??==)
- High availability across zones (==ELB is crossing AZs==)
- Separate public traffic from private traffic 
- ELB integrated with other AWS services:
	- EC2, auto scaling group, ECS
	- AWS certificate manager, cloudwatch
	- Route 53, etc

## Health Check

by:
- protocol e.g. HTTP
- port e.g. 8080
- endpoint /health
expect: **response 200**

## ELB Security Group

Define the incoming/==TODO: and outgoing== traffics with:
- Protocol
- Port range
- Source IP range
==Application SG has to set its source to the ELB SG rather than any **IP range**==

## Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)

To achieve that same client is always redirected to the same instance behind the load balancer:
"Cookie" is used with expiration date.

- Application based Cookies
- Duration based Cookies

## Cross Zone Load Balancing

- Enabled by default for Application Load Balancer
- Disabled by default for the rest LB types
- With Cross-zone load balancing enabled: that requests are **evenly** distributed among all instances behind (in all AZs)

## Application Load Balancer

### Intro

1. Layer 7 load balancer , namely only supports HTTP/ HTTPs
2. Load balancing:
	1. across multi instances
	2. multi apps on the same instance (e.g. containers)
	3. routing tables (**Rules**) to different target groups:
		- path in the url, e.g. example.com/usrs vs example.com/posts
		- hostname in the url, e.g one.example.com vs other.example.com
		- query string, headers, e.g. example.com/user?id=1
1. great fit for micro-services, docker app -  ==port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port in ECS (TODO: what is this??)==
3. You will get fixed hostname
4. The application server (maybe on EC2) don't see the IP of client directly, but inserted in the **header at X-Forward-For, port at X-Forward-port** etc
5. Unlike NLB, whose IP address can't be a fixed one

## Target Group candidates

- EC2 instances (that can be managed by an Auto Scaling Group) -- HTTP
- ECS tasks (managed by ECS) - HTTP
- Lambda function - HTTP requests are translated into json event
- IP addresses - private IPs

## Network Load Balancer

1. Routes TCP, UDP traffic
2. front end facing TCP and reroute the traffic to back end that can be **HTTP**, **TCP** target group, where target group candidates:
	1. EC2 instances
	2. Private IP addresses - your own data centre, application load balancer
- Health check supports HTTP, HTTPS, TCP end points

## Gateway Load Balancer

### intro

- Deploy, scale, and manage a fleet of 3rd party network virtual appliances in AWS
- Layer 3 (Network layer) - IP packets
- Transparent Network Gateway - single entry/exit for all traffic
- Load balancing - distribute traffic to the virtual appliances, use case like:
	1. user traffic comes to Gateway Load Balancer
	2. Gateway load balancer load balances among 3rd party virtual appliances
	3. forward the traffic to application (destination)

### Target Group Candidates

- EC2 instance
- Private IPs

# SSL/TLS

- SSL certificate allows traffic between the the client and load balancer is encrypted, **in flight encryption**, and can only be decrypted by sender/receiver.  
- TLS is an upgraded version of SSL
- Issued by Certificate Authorities
- SSL in load balancer
		- **certificates managed by ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)**
	- Client can use **SNI (Server Name Indication)** to specify the hostname they reach
		- SNI: Multiple Listeners requires Multiple SSL certificates, configured to multiple **target groups** for different websites, through **One load balancer (ALB, NLB and CloudFront)**

# Connection draining / De-registration Delay

- "grace period" for your draining ec2 instance to complete the ongoing client request before put to "dead", time max 5 mins
- so set to low value if normally the request are short in processing

# Auto Scaling Group

- Scale out -> add EC2 instance to match an **increase** load
- Scale in -> remove EC2 instance to march a **decreased** load
- ASG is able to create a new instance while ELB detects an **unhealthy** on an existing instance
- always requires a **Launch Template**
	- AMI + instance type
	- EC2 user data
	- EBS volume
	- Security Groups
	- SSH key pair
	- etc
- cloudwatch triggers the ASG scaling in/out
	- cloudwatch monitoring metrics e.g. cpu usage
		 - CPU Utilization
		 - Request Count per target - control number of request sent to an ec2 is stable
		 - Average network in/out
		 - or custom metrics
	- triggers ASG **scale in** or **scale out** based on monitoring an alarm
- Dynamic Scaling Policies
	- Target tracking scaling - e.g. I want the average ASG CPU to stay at around 40%
		-**It create cloudwatch for us instead when detection of set metric rule activated**
	- Simple / Step scaling - e.g. when cloudwatch trigger alarm, then scaling in/out
	- Scheduled Actions - e.g. to scale out on Friday nights
	- Predictive scaling
