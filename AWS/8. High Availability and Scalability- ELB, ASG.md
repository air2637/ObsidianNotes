# Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)

- Spread load across multiple downstream instances
- Expose a single point of access [[DNS]] to your application
- Failover seamlessly
- Regular health check to your instances
- SSL termination (HTTPS) for your website (==TODO: what is this??==)
- Enforce stickiness with cookies (==TODO: what??==)
- High availability across zones (==ELB is crossing AZs==)
- Separate public traffic from private traffic 

## Health Check

by:
- protocol e.g. HTTP
- port e.g. 8080
- endpoint /health
expect: **response 200**

## ELB Security Group

Define the incoming/==TODO: and outgoing== traffics with:
- Protocol
- Port range
- Source IP range

==Application SG has to set its source to the ELB SG rather than any **IP range**==

## Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)

To achieve that same client is always redirected to the same instance behind the load balancer:
"Cookie" is used with expiration date.

- Application based Cookies
- Duration based Cookies

## Cross Zone Load Balancing

- Enabled by default for Application Load Balancer
- Disabled by default for the rest LB types
- With Cross-zone load balancing enabled: that requests are **evenly** distributed among all instances behind

# Application Load Balancer

## Intro

1. Layer 7 load balancer , namely only supports HTTP/ HTTPs
2. It allows the reroute from HTTP to HTTPs at load balancer level (==TODO: so you don't need to do it in your app??==)
3. Routing tables to different **target groups**
	- path in the url, e.g. example.com/usrs vs example.com/posts
	- hostname in the url, e.g one.example.com vs other.example.com
	- query string, headers, e.g. example.com/user?id=1
4. great fit for micro-services, docker app
5. ==port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port in ECS (TODO: what is this??)==
6. You will get fixed hostname
7. The application server (maybe on EC2) don't see the IP of client directly, but inserted in the **header at X-Forward-For, port at X-Forward-port** etc
8. Unlike NLB, the IP address can't be a fixed one

## Target Group candidates

- EC2 instances (that can be managed by an Auto Scaling Group) -- HTTP
- ECS tasks (managed by ECS) - HTTP
- Lambda function - HTTP requests are translated into json event
- IP addresses - private IPs

# Network Load Balancer

1. Routes TCP, UDP traffic
2. front end facing TCP and reroute the traffic to back end that can be **HTTP**, **TCP** target group.
	- what can be the target groups:
		- EC2 instances
		- IP addressed - must be **private IPs**
		- Application Load Balancer
		- Health check supports HTTP, HTTPS, TCP end points

# Gateway Load Balancer

# intro

- Deploy, scale, and manage a fleet of 3rd party network virtual appliances in AWS
- Layer 3 (Network layer) - IP packets
- Transparent Network Gateway - single entry/exit for all traffic
- Load balancing - distribute traffic to the virtual appliances

## Target Group Candidates

- EC2 instance
- Private IPs

# SSL/TLS

- SSL certificate allows traffic between the the client and load balancer is encrypted, **in flight encryption**, and can only be decrypted by sender/receiver.  
- TLS is an upgraded version of SSL
- Issued by Certificate Authorities
- SSL in load balancer
	- certificates managed by ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)
	- Client can use SNI (Server Name Indication) to specify the hostname they reach

### Server Name Indication

Multiple Listeners requires Multiple SSL certificates, configured to multiple target groups for different websites, through **One load balancer (ALB, NLB and CloudFront)**

## Connection draining / De-registration Delay

==TODO: dont understand the draining at all==

# Auto Scaling Group

- Scale out -> add EC2 instance to match an increase load
- Scale in -> remove EC2 instance to march a decreased load
- Auto register new instances to a load balancer

## Launch Template - required by ASG

- AMI + Instance Type
- EC2 User data
- EBS Volume
- Security Groups
- SSH Key Pair
- IAM Roles for your EC2 instaces
- Network + Subnets info
- Load Balancer info

## Triggers auto scaling

- Cloudwatch alarms, e.g Average CPU, custom metric

## Dynamic Scaling Policies

- Target tracking scaling - e.g. I want the average ASG CPU to stay at around 40%
	-**It create cloudwatch for us instead when detection of set metric rule activated**
- Simple / Step scaling - e.g. when cloudwatch trigger alarm, then ...
- Scheduled Actions - e.g. to scale out on Friday nights
