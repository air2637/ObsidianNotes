## Object Encryption

- Server side encryption (SSE)
	- with amazon s3 managed keys (SSE-S3) - **Default encryption**
		 - the key totally owned and managed by aws
	- with key managed by aws kms (SSE-KMS)
		 - the key created by customer and stored in aws KMS
		 - each request(both upload and download) will invoke the key from KMS
		 - cloudTrail used to log the invoking
		 - in large s3 upload/download cases, may get throttle due to KMS invoke quota per second
	- with customer provided key (SSE-C)
		 - keys are managed by outside aws
		 - our own responsibility to attach encryption key in HTTPS header
- Client side encryption
	- encrypt data from client side before sending the S3
- Encryption in transit (SSL/TLS)
	- HTTPS endpoint - the connection between client and s3 server is fully encrypted
	- we can **enforce the rule of encryption in transit** from bucket policy - **aws:SecureTransport**
 
## CORs

- Cross-origin resource sharing
- origin = scheme(protocol) + host(domain) + port, e.g. https://www.example.com (implied port 443)
- request won't be fulfilled for CORS header is **Access-Control-Allow-Origin**:
	- web browser make a HTTP request to web server http://www.example.com (origin)
	- while this request need to get resources from another web server http://www.other.com (cross-origin)
	- if the Cross-origin is not allowed, the access is denied, vice versa
- How is it related to S3?
	- web browser request for a page index.html in my-bucket-html with host as http://my-bucket-html.s3-website.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
	- the index.html needs to load images from another bucket my-bucket-assets with host as http://my-bucket-assets.s3-website.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
	- So, in order to make above work, we need to **add the url of 1st URL in CORS policy of the  2nd bucket** 
		- either **specific origin**
		- or all with asterisk

## MFA Delete

- Multi-factor authentication for :
	- delete an object version
	- suspend versioning on the bucket
	- Only bucket owner (**root account**) can toggle

## S3 access logs

- the **logging bucket** must be in **same region** as the monitored bucket

## S3 pre-signed URLs

- Temporary url to objects in s3 bucket to other non-ower users
- works for private bucket (not public accessible bucket)

## S3 Glacier Vault Lock

- WORM (write once read many) model
- create a vault policy
- lock the policy so no future edit

## S3 Object Lock (versioning must be enabled)

- Block an s3 object version deletion for a specified amount of time
- Retention mode:
	- compliance - no user is exception, that no one including root account cannot do any modification on the versions
	- governance - in contrast to above, some users are allowed to delete the versions
 - legal hold 
	 - except someone who has the *putObjectLegalHold* iam permission, that no one can remove the object
  
## Access Points

- A specific access point that having its specific access to data in a s3 bucket
- e.g. Finance user access **Finance access Point** which allows the read, write operations to finance folder in s3 bucket, similarly to Sales, Analytics
- each access points has:
	- it is own DNS name
	- policy in terms of accessibility in s3 bucket
- How to setup?
	- define the access point to be accessible only from within the VPC
	- create the VPC to access the access point via either Gateway/ Interface Endpoint
	- Make sure VPC endpoint policy is allowed to access tot he target bucket , Access Point
