# How DNS Works?

1. Web browser wants to know the IP address of "example.com" and access it 
2. It checks the **Local DNS Server** that provided by ISP
3. Local DNS Server then checks the followings:
	1. Root DNS Server for **NameServer** of ".com"
	2. **Top Level Domain** for NameServer of "example.com"
	3. **Sub Level Domain** like Amazon Registrar for IP address of "example.com"
4. Local DNS Server **cache** it, so it is asked next time, the IP will be directly returned.

# Route 53

- Highly available, scalable, fully managed and **Authoritative** DNS
	- Authoritative = You can update the DNS records
- It is also a **Domain Registrar**
- 100% availability **SLA**
- Record:
	- It defines how you want to route traffic for a domain
	- each record contains:
		- Domain/subdomain Name - e.g. example.com
		- Record Type e.g. A or AAAA
		- Value e.g. 12.34.56.78 (IP address ??)
		- Routing Policy - how route 53 responds to queries
		- TTL (Time to live) - amount of time the records cached at DNS Resolvers
- Support DNS record types:
	- A -maps a hostname to IPV4,
	- AAAA - maps a hostname to IPV6,
	- CNAME - maps a hostname to another hostname (the other hostname must have an A or AAAA record),
	- NS - Name Servers for the **Hosted Zone**
	- Alias - For pointing to a resource of AWS, details [[10. Route 53 (1h20min)#CNAME vs Alias]]
- Hosted Zone:
	- a container for records
	- Public Hosted Zones - contains records that for routing traffic on the **Internet**
	- Private Hosted Zones - contains records that for routing traffic within one or more VPCs (e.g. intranet??)
	- Pay $0.5 per month per hosted zone
- command to find the record details:
	- nslookup test.example.com

## TTL

- High TTL: less traffic on Route53, but possibly outdated records
- Low TTL: more traffic on Route53, Records are outdated for less time
- Except for Alias records, TTL is mandatory for each Record

### CNAME vs Alias
- CNAME:
	- points a hostname (only for **non root domain**) to any other hostname
- Alias: 
	- points a hostname (can be root domain or non root domain) to an aws resource:
		- Elastic Load Balancer
		- Amazon cloudFront
		- S3 websites
		- VPC interface endpoints
		- etc
		- but NOT EC2 DNS name
	- record is of type A / AAAA for AWS resources (so IPV4/6) 
	- No TTL
 
### Routing Policies

- Define how Route53 responds to DNS queries
- Routing policies
	- Simple: 
		- route traffic to a single resource
		- if multiple value returns, chose random one:
			1. Client check "foo.example.com" from Route53
			2. Route53 returns 3 type A records
			3. Client choses a random value
		- No health check
	- Weighted:
		- Control % of requests that goes to each specific resource by assigning the percentage to each of the records
		- DNS records must of same **name and type**
		- Support health check of the ==TODO:record???==
	- Failover
	- Latency based:
		- DNS records must of same **name and type**
		- direct to record representing resources that least latency
		- latency is based on traffic between users and aws regions
	- Geolocation
		 - user location based routing
		 - use cases - website localisation / content restriction / load balancing etc
	- Multi-value:
		- returns up to 8 **healthy record** for each multi-value query, and ==TODO: client request will be randomly assigned to one of them==
	- Geoproximity
		- Similar to Geolocation based routing, but this allows you to shift more traffic to **resource in another region** based on specified **bias**

## Health Checks

- Only applicable to **Public resources**
- Health check leads to **automated DNS Failover** (One record to another)
	- Health check monitoring an endpoint (application, server, other aws resources)
	- Health check monitoring other health checks == **Caculated health checks**
	- Health check monitoring cloudwatch alarms
 - Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC - Health check ping the endpoint from all over the world, so Security Group rule needs to whitelist those sources of API calls
 - For resources in private VPC:
	 - create cloudwatch and associate a cloudwatch alarm
	 - create health check that checks the alarm instead
 - Failover leveraging on this health check

## Domain Registrar vs. DNS Service

- They are independent - you can register your domain name "example.com" from any domain registrar e.g. 'GoDaddy' but use AWS Route53 to provide the DNS Services, or vice versa.
- DNS Services - managing the DNS records, routing policies, health checks
- Steps if you want the domain registered from other Registrar but DNS service managed by Route53:
	- Go to the Domain Registrar's own DNS service page
	- Use the custom nameservers, replace them with the  **Name server addresses in Public Hosted Zone** of AWS Route53
