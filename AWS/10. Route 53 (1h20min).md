# How DNS Works?

1. Web browser wants to know the IP address of "example.com" and access it 
2. It checks the **Local DNS Server** that provided by ISP
3. Local DNS Server then checks the followings:
	1. Root DNS Server for **NameServer** of ".com"
	2. **Top Level Domain** for NameServer of "example.com"
	3. **Sub Level Domain** like Amazon Registrar for IP address of "example.com"
4. Local DNS Server **cache** it, so it is asked next time, the IP will be directly returned.

# Route 53

- Highly available, scalable, fully managed and **Authoritative** DNS
	- Authoritative = You can update the DNS records
- It is also a **Domain Registrar**
- 100% availability **SLA**
- Record:
	- It defines how you want to route traffic for a domain
	- each record contains:
		- Domain/subdomain Name - e.g. example.com
		- Record Type e.g. A or AAAA
		- Value e.g. 12.34.56.78 (IP address ??)
		- Routing Policy - how route 53 responds to queries
		- TTL (Time to live) - amount of time the records cached at DNS Resolvers
- Support DNS record types:
	- A -maps a hostname to IPV4,
	- AAAA - maps a hostname to IPV6,
	- CNAME - maps a hostname to another hostname (the other hostname must have an A or AAAA record),
	- NS - Name Servers for the **Hosted Zone**
- Hosted Zone:
	- a container for records
	- Public Hosted Zones - contains records that for routing traffic on the **Internet**
	- Private Hosted Zones - contains records that for routing traffic within one or more VPCs (e.g. intranet??)
	- Pay $0.5 per month per hosted zone
- command to find the record details:
	- nslookup test.example.com

## TTL

- High TTL: less traffic on Route53, but possibly outdated records
- Low TTL: more traffic on Route53, Records are outdated for less time
- Except for Alias records, TTL is mandatory for each Record

### CNAME vs Alias

- CNAME:
	- points a hostname (only for **non root domain**) to any other hostname
- Alias: 
	- points a hostname (can be root domain or non root domain) to an aws resource:
		- Elastic Load Balancer
		- Amazon cloudFront
		- S3 websites
		- VPC interface endpoints
		- etc
		- but NOT EC2 DNS name
	- record is of type A / AAAA for AWS resources (so IPV4/6) 
	- No TTL
 
### Routing Policies

- Define how Route53 responds to DNS queries
- Routing policies
	- Simple: 
		- route traffic to a single resource
		- if multiple value returns, chose random one:
			1. Client check "foo.example.com" from Route53
			2. Route53 returns 3 type A records
			3. Client choses a random value
		- No health check
	- Weighted:
		- Control % of requests that goes to each specific resource by assigning the percentage to each of the records
		- DNS records must of same **name and type**
		- Support health check of the ==TODO:record???==
	- Failover
	- Latency based:
		- DNS records must of same **name and type**
		- direct to record representing resources that least latency
		- latency is based on traffic between users and aws regions
	- Geolocation
	- Multi-value answer
	- Geoproximity
