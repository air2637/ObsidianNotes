## EBS

- Network drive attached to EC2 instance, only if **EBS and EC2 are in same AZ**
- attached to **One instance** at a time
- bound to the **AZ** -> no crossing AZ usage, unless **taking a snapshot** first
- default to **delete on termination** for EC2 instance

## EBS Snapshot

- Served as a backup of your current EBS
- Detaching volume for backup is not necessary but recommended 
- Snapshot can be copied across AZs
- Snapshot Archive:
	- cheaper comparing to normal snapshot
	- taken with 24-72 hours to restart the archived snapshot, or pay for **Fast Snapshot Restore**
	- Recommend to **retain deleted snapshot**, but need to specify retention period (1 day to 1 year)

## AMI ##

- Amazon Machine Image - customised EC2 instance
	- faster boot time, as all the softwares are **pre-packaged**
- AMI is built for a **specific region**, but can be copied across AZs
- Launch EC2 instances based on:
	- A public AMI - built by AWS
	- Your own AMI - you maintain it
	- AMI marketplace AMI - someone else build
- How to create one AMI on your own:
	1. Start an EC2, and customise it
	2. stop the EC2 (for **Integrity**)
	3. build an AMI based on the EC2 - will also create EBS snapshot
		 - right click on the EC2 
		 - image and template > create image
	4. launch instance on the AMI

## EC2 instance store

- For high-performance disk: hard disk connected to EC2 instance physically
- Good throughput 
- Ephemeral - **If you stop the EC2 instance, the storage lost** - reason being, EC2 instance is virtual, when you stop, AWS does not remember the physical server previously with the physical hard disk you connected 
- Good more short term use cases - buffer / cache etc
- Your responsibility to backup the content is EC2 instance store

## EBS Volume Types

- General Purpose SSD - gp2, gp3
	- **System boot volume**
	- gp3 allows you to set **volumes** and **IOPS** independently, while gp2 are **lined**
- Provisioned IOPS SSD - io1 , io2
	- For critical app needs **sustained IOPS performance** , more then 16,000 IOPS, e.g. DB workloads
	- Supports EBS multi-attach
- Hard Disk Drives HDD - st1
	- **cannot be a boot volume**
	- **low IOPS**
	- for storing big data, logs

## Multi-attach##

- Only available to io1, io2
- attach the **same EBS** to **multiple EC2 instances** , of course in the **same AZ**
- **Up to attaching 16 EC2 instance at a time**
- Must use a **file system that is cluster-aware** not XFS, EX4 etc

## EBS Encryption##

- Data stored in EBS is encrypted
- Data transmitted between instance and EBS is encrypted (network drive right!)
- all snapshot is encrypted
- all volumes created from the encrypted snapshot is encrypted
- **Encryption has minimal impact on latency**
- Encryption leverage on **KMS**

## EFS - Elastic File System##

- supports **cross AZs** multi-attach
- Highly available , scalable, expensive (3 times of gp2 price)
- You need to set **Security Group** for the EFS
- use cases - content management (wordpress), web serving, data sharing
- **ONLY for linux based AMI**
- Performance Modes
	- General purpose - low latency, e.g. web server, CMS
	- MAX IO - higher latency but higher IOs, e.g. media processing
- Throughput Modes
	- Bursting - normally operated at a IO rate, but can be boosted to another higher rate
	- Provisioned - set a fixed throughput
	- Elastic - auto scale throughput up and down
- Storage Class
	- Storage Tiers
		- standard - for frequently access files, **multi-AZs**
		- infrequent access - with **lifecycle policy** setting, e.g. move file to infrequent access tier after **no access to a file for 60 days**, **One Zone only**

## Finally, EBS vs EFS##

- normally one instance, except io1, io2, but still **one AZ** constraint
- in contrast, EFS supports **multi-AZs** + **multi-attach**
- To migrate EBS cross AZ:
	- take snapshot
	- restore the snapshot in another AZ
