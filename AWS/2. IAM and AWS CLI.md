## Users & Groups

- Root account 
	- created by default, and **NO Shared,  NO used** except setting up an account
- User - represents the actual people user
- Group - contains one or more Users, but **NO sub groups**
- An User can exist without a Group
- An User can belongs to multiple Groups

## Permissions

- Permissions for User/Group are managed by **Policy** - a json
- Follow **the least privilege principle**

## Sign in

- Root user
- IAM user (for User non-root account)

## IAM policy json

- version: which policy language version the json complies to
- id - optional, identifier of the policy
- statement - one or more entries, and each entry contains:
	- sid - optional
	- effect - allow/deny the access
	- principal - user/group/[[2. IAM and AWS CLI#Role]]
	- action - the action taking on the resource, e.g. S3:GetObject, S3:PutObject
	- resource - of course, we need to tell the constrained resource
 
## Defend User account

- IAM Password Policy, specifies:
	- set a minimum password length
	- require specific character types
	- allow all IAM user to change their own password
	- password expiration
- Multi-factor Authentication
	- Password you know + **Security device** you own 
	- Virtual MFA device - e.g. Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator etc
	- Physical MFA device

## Access AWS

- web console via login of user account
- AWS CLI - protected by **Access key**
	- can try web based console - **cloud shell**
- AWS SDK - call API , also protected by same AWS CLI **Access key**
- Access key
	- Access Key ID - like username
	- Secret Access Key - like password
 
## Role

- used by system, representing a physical user
- Common use cases:
	- Ec2 instance roles
	- Lambda roles
	- cloudFormation roles

## IAM Security Tools

- IAM Credentials Report (**Account-level**)
	- List all your account's users, and credential status
- IAM Access Advisor (**User-level**)
	- Permission granted to a specific user and when those services are accessed
		- so **You can refine the access granted to the user, when you see some services being granted but never been used by the user**


## Additional References

- accounts, users, roles - as root user for an account, you can create multiple users and roles under the same account. How to manage the accessibilities to different resources, e.g. separating by environments like dev, uat, prod / e.g. separating by resources with / without **resource level** permissions (s3, RDS has , while ELB, ASG does not) - refer to [guidelines for when to use accounts, users, groups](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/guidelines-for-when-to-use-accounts-users-and-groups/):
	- Using **multiple accounts** - for resources in different environments
	- Using IAM users, groups and resource tags in a **single account** - concerns over resources has no resource level permissions
	- **hybrid with 2 accounts** + IAM users, groups, tags
