## Database Types:

- RDBMS - RDS, Aurora that great for joins
- NoSQL - no joins, DynamoDB(Json based), ElastiCache (for key value pair)
- Object store - S3, Glacier(backup, archives)
- Data warehouse - RedShift
- Search: OpenSearch (Json)
- Graph: Amazon Neptune - displays relationships between data
- Ledger: Amazon Quantum Ledger Database
- Time series: Amazon timestream


## RDS

- includes PostgreSql/ MySql/ Oracle/ SQL Server/ MariaDB / Custom
- Provisioned - so you need to specify the ==instance size, EBS volume type, and size==
- Auto-scaling enabled
- Support ==Read Replicas and multi-AZs== (through Snapshots?? -> no it is through async, and it changing from single AZ to multi AZ, a sync happens)
- Security through IAM, SG, KMS, SSL in transit
- ==Automated backup and Point in time restore== but within 35 days only
- However, for long term backup, do **Manual DB snapshot**
- ==Downtime expected== during the maintenance window
- RDS Custom if you wanna ssh and manage on instance on your own

## Aurora

- Supports PostgreSql, Mysql
- It is distributed (AKA cluster) - 6 replica, across 3 AZs, **highly available, auto-scaling**
- Since it is cluster, it has custom endpoints for writer and reader
- Backup and restore options 
	- through snapshot saved in s3
	- Aurora mysql supported with Percona XtraBackup, a new cluster will be running
- Since it is **Serverless** - good for **Unpredictable** workload
- ==Multi-master== if you wanna ==write failover==
- Aurora global is optional??
- Has machine learning module - SageMaker , Comprehend
- ==Aurora Database Cloning== is faster than taking snapshot and restore
	- reason being, the data volume is shared, and only start copying when new data transaction comes

## ElastiCache

- **Requires application code to cater if using ElastiCache**
- In-memory, key value pair
- Support multi-AZs, Read Replicas
- Use cases: Frequent reads and less writes - cache result for DB queries, store session data for web

## DynamoDB

- for NoSQL
- **Capacity mode** - provisioned with auto scaling, or on-demand
- ==Read , Write are decoupled==
- DAX cluster for read cache
- Great for ==evolving schema==
- Use cases: Serverless applications development, distributed serverless cache

## S3

- ==batch operations== - S3 batch, listing files using S3 Inventory

## DocumentDB

- like Aurora to Mysql/PostgreSQL, DocumentDB is the 'Aurora' to MangoDB, where MangoDB is for storing, querying, and indexing JSON data

## Amazon keyspaces

- fuck, for exam purpose, just associate it with Apache Cassandra 


## Amazon QLDB - Quantum Ledger DB

- A ledger - a book for recording financial transactions
- so it named Ledger, because all changes to the DB is **immutable** and user can review the changes to DB over time.
