## What is serverless mean?

- you still have server, but you don't need to manage it!
- serverless infra in AWS:
	- lambda
	- Dynamo DB (um..what things happened in DB, to trigger lambda), Aurora DB
	- Cognito - for login services
	- API Gateway - um..  it create Restful API based on which lambda is invoked
	- S3 - for storage
	- SNS, SQS, Kinesis Firehose
	- Step function - what is it??
	- Fargate - ECS

## AWS Lambda

- limited by time, maximum 15 minutes running time
- Scaling is automated
- Pricing, with 2 factors - request count and execution time per request
- Language support - if not natively supported, you can leverage on **Custom Runtime API** / ==Lambda Container Image== (the lambda has to the docker image that has to **implement AWS Lambda API**, otherwise, run the ECS fargate) 
- use cases:
	- **Serverless Cron Job** - CloudWatch Events Bridge configured with rule, say triggered every 1 hour, Lambda gets subsequently triggered

### Lambda Limitations - per Region

- Memory between 128MB to 10GB
- Maximum execution time 15 mins
- Environment Variable size cap at 4 kb
- Disk capacity (must be in /tmp path): cap at 10 GB
- concurrency execution: 1000 (can be increased)

### CloudFront Functions vs Lambda@Edge

- Both are **Edge Functions** - a code you attached to **CloudFront distributions** for ==minimising the latency==, and again, you don't need to manage the servers, as the code is **deployed globally**
- Basic flow:
	- Client <-- **Viewer Request & Response** --> CloudFront <-- **Origin Request & Response**> Origin
- CloudFront functions:
	-  light-weight **javascript**, ==million requests/ sec==
	- function intercepts **Viewer Request or Viewer Response**
- Lambda@Edge:
	- slightly heavier logic written in NodeJS/Python, but 1000s/sec
	- function intercepts both **Viewer Request, Response** and **Origin Request, Response**

### Lambda in VPC

- By default, lambda function created is outside any your existing VPC, but a brand new VPC managed by AWS itself
- But **You have to put the lambda into your VPC, in order to access the resources within it**, e.g. RDS
- So you need to:
	- ==You define the VPC id, Subnets, and SG==
	- underlying, an ENI for the lambda is created within the specified VPC, subnets that guarded by the SG
	- Don't forget to use ==**RDS Proxy**==, as we don't want thousands of connections to your DB, the proxy **pooling and sharing DB connection**, the proxy sits in VPC too

### Invoking Lambda by RDS - Postgres SQL and Aurora Mysql

- when there is an DB data change, you want to invoke the lambda. E.g. When user table get new entries, you invoke the lambda which is for sending welcome email to the users
- Network connectivity - **Must allow outbound traffic to your lambda function from the DB instance**
- Permission granted - for DB to invoke lambda
	- Lambda resource based policy
	- IAM policy

## AWS DynamoDB

- A ==**Cloud native** NoSQL== DB,
	- cloud native because the instance are distributed instances
	- You **don't create schema, but just create tables** as it is NOSQL, ==**So it is a good DB option, if your schema needs to Rapidly evolve**==
- Low-cost, auto-scaling
- No maintenance required
- Two kinds - Standard Class, Infrequent Access (IA) table class

### DynamoDB Capacity Modes

- Provision Mode (default)
	- You plan beforehand - specify the reads, writes throughput (per second)
	- **You can add auto scaling to the throughput**
- On-demand Mode
	- **No capacity planning needed**
	- Pay as per you use, so more expensive
	- **Fit for unpredictable workloads** or having **sudden spikes in workload**
