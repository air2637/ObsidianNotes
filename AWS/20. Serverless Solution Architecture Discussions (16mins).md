## Mobile App - MyTodoList

Keywords:
- S3 access to user - Cognito, that generates temporary credential with **==STS== to access S3 bucket with restrict policy**, similar applications to DynamoDB, Lambda etc
- Caching records with DAX
- Caching the REST requests at API Gateway
- Security for authentication and authorization with Cognito and STS


## Serverless Website - MyBlog.com

Keywords:
- static content, globally -> S3 + CloudFront Global Distribution
- securely -> Origin Access Control (only CloudFront can access S3) + Bucket Policy
- Optionally global -> **DynamoDB Global table**
- Send email when data changes -> DynamoDB Stream[^ref1] + Lambda + Simple Email Service (SES)

[^ref1]: Having DynamoDB Stream enabled, it will ==generates db change logs==, so it is important to enable it when **Creating an DynamoDB global table**

## Microservices Architecture

Reason for using microservices:
- leaner development cycle for each service
- A service could be powered with various solutions:
	- ELB + ECS + DynamoDB
	- API Gateway + Lambda + ElasticCache
	- ELB + ASG of EC2 + RDS

Synchronous patterns: API Gateway, Load Balancer
Asynchronous patterns: SQS, Kinesis, SNS, Lambda triggers

## Software updates distribution

- Challenge: we want to update software running on ec2 instances **across AZs / Regions**  with no much overhead like terminating instances and reboot a new one. 
- Hint: software updates are **static**
- Solution: 
	- EFS + CloudFront distribution
	- EFS is multi-attach, and CloudFront does caching
