## Requester pays

- normally, owner of the S3 bucket bearing the bucket storage cost + networking cost (uploading + downloading)
- in Requester Pays , that client (maybe another account) pays the networking cost
- Use case:
	- the requester must be an AWS account
	- helpful in sharing large datasets

## S3 Event Notifications

- events on:
	- object created, removed, restored, replication etc
- filtering on patterns
- evens to:
	- SNS, SQS, Lambda
	- or **Amazon EventBridge**:
		- takes all events
		- configured with rules (more granular, e.g. metadata, data size, name etc)
		- **multi destinations**
		- allows archive events, replay events, reliable delivery

- reminder - [allow the s3 to notify a SQS in policy](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/sqs-s3-event-notification-sse)

## S3 performance

- recommend using **multipart uploading** for file size > 100MB, and mandatory for file size > 5 GB
- S3 transfer acceleration - transfer files through edge locations - minimise the traffic on public network, but maximise the traffic over private network(faster)
- **S3 byte range fetches** - for speeding up the downloads (similar but opposite to multipart uploading)

## S3 select & Glacier select

- retrieve data in s3 file with SQL
- filter by rows, columns
- less network transfer

## S3 batch operations

- bulk operations on s3 objects:
	- copy objects between s3 buckets
	- encrypt all objects in a buckets
	- restore objects from s3 glacier
	- invoke lambda functions for each s3 objects
- rationale - a job consists **list of objects**, with **actions** required and **optional parameters**
- a typical workflow:
	- **s3 inventory** to get object list reports
	- **s3 select** to filter on desired data
	- user create batch operations with s3 objects, actions, and parameters
	- objects get processed as desired
