## EC2 Modules

- virtual machines EC2
- virtual drive for storing data :
	- Network-attached: EBS, EFS
	- hardware: EC2 instance store
- load balancer - ELB
- Scaling service - ASG
- Network card: 
	- speed of the card
	- public IP address
- Firewall rules: security group
- Bootstrap script configured at first launch: EC2 user data
	- only run **once** at the instance **first start**
	- use cases:
		- installing updates / softwares
		- downloading common files from the internet
		- or anything else
	- run with **root** user rights

## Setup EC2 instance

- Stop instance 
	- aws will keep the state e.g. the EBS attached to it, but not charging you
- Instance types
	- naming convention e.g. m5.2xlarge
		- m - instance class
		- 5 - the generations
		- 2xlarge - size of memory, hard disk, network bandwidth etc
	  - general purpose - balanced between **Compute, Memory, Networking**
		  - code repo, simple web server
	  - compute optimised - "C instance class", very good cpu 
		  - batch processing
		  - media transcoding
		  - high performance web server
		  - Scientific modelling, machine learning
		  - dedicated game servers
	- memory optimised - "R instance class", processing large data in memory
		- DB
		- Distributed web scale cache stores
		- Business Intelligence
	- storage optimised - high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage
		- Data warehousing applications, OLTP system
		- Cache for in-memory databased

## Security Group - for network security

- control traffic into / out of EC2 instance
- SG only contain whitelist = **allow** rules
- SG can reference by **IP** or by other **SG**
	- For allow rules on another SG, with specified port, we don't concern on the IP address anymore. e.g.
		- instance A with rules allow inbound traffic of SG_B, port 123
		- instance B attached with SG_B can access instance A thorough port 123
- specifically, SG regulates:
	- ports
	- IP ranges (IPV4, IPV6)
	- inbound traffic
	- outbound traffic
- a SG can be attached to multiple EC2 instances
- scope of SG is within a **region / VPC combination**
- if your application is not accessible due to **time out**, it is SG issue, in contrast, "connection refused" error is due to application error / application is not launched
- by default, all inbound is blocked, all outbound traffic is allowed

## Common ports

22 - SSH
21 - FTP
22 - SFTP, file uploading with SSH
80 - HTTP, unsecured web access
443 - HTTPS, secured web access
3389 - RDP, remote desktop protocol, login to a windows instance

## Connecting EC2 instance with SSH

- If SSH not working, use **EC2 instance connect** (web based ssh based terminal)
- SSH
	- control remote machines through terminal
	- troubleshooting:
		- connection timeout - check the SG rules
		- connection refused - is SSH correctly installed, running on the target server?
		- permission denied - is security key correct? is user correct (ec2-user)?

## Assign IAM Role to EC2 instance

- grant the ec2 the required permissions
- no "aws configure" required - no exposure of access token, as [[2. IAM and AWS CLI#Access AWS]]

## EC2 instances purchasing options

- On-demand instances
	- fit for **short workload, predicable pricing, pay by seconds**
	- **no upfront payment, nor long term commitment**
- Reserved 
	- 1 or 3 years, with payment options: No upfront, partial upfront, all upfront
	- committed to instance type, region, tenancy(Host, Dedicated, Default)
	- can be re-sell / buy in **Reserved instance marketplace**
	- Reserved instances - **long workload**
	- **Convertible Reserved instances** - long workload with **flexible instance types**
- Saving plans
	- 1 or 3 years
	- committed to the amount of usage in dollars, e.g. I want to pay $10 /hour for 1 or 3 years, any usage beyond, pay as On-demand instances rate
- Spot instances
	- **short workload**, cheap (biggest discount)
	- can lose instance if the threshold rate you set less than current spot price -> less reliable
	- so fit for app that resilient to failures
	- **To terminate a sport instance** when the request type is **Persistent**, in contrast to **One-time**
		1. **Cancel a spot request**
		2. **terminate associated spot instance**
	- **Spot fleet**
		- launch instances from pool of spot instances
		- **lowest** strategy - to get the lowest spot instance defined in the pool
- Dedicated Hosts
	- book an **entire physical server**, you have the access to the physical server, if you need low level control (control instance **replacement**)
	- so fit for **compliance** requirement - server bound software license
	- purchasing options - On-demand, RI
	- **Most expensive options** 
- Dedicated instances
	- **No other customers will share your hardware**
	- May share hardware with other instances in same account
	- diff from Dedicated hosts that you don't have access to the physical server only
- Capacity Reservations
	- reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration
	- still get charged even when no instance is running
	- fit for **short term, uninterrupted workloads in a specific AZ**
