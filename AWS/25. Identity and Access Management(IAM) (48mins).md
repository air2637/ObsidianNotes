## OU & SCP

- Service Control Policy - 
	- policies applied to Organization Unit, Account, User, and Roles
	- **NOT** applicable to **Management Account** as it always have full access
	- Two types of strategies in policy: 
		- Blocklist - line item `AllowsAllActions` + line items with `Effect` as `Deny`
		- Allowlist - only line items with `Effect` as `Deny`
	- **child OU** inherits the permission from its parent OU

## IAM Role vs Resource based Policy vs ACL

- IAM Role:
	- You created the role and specify the permissions allowed/denied for the role
- Resource based policy:
	- Resource specific, e.g. S3 policy
	- You specify **who (principle)** can access **this** resource, hence, it is applicable for users **cross account** if you specify the account and user explicitly in the policy
	 - **Less preferred if you can manage it in IAM Role**
 - ACL (Access Control List)
	 - It is the **old way** of managing permissions, so the least preferred
	 - while you can have more **granular control** over access

One more thing, **Resource based policy** vs **AssumeRole** in **Cross Account** context:
- AssumeRole :
	- Role as a proxy
	- If you to use AssumeRole, you are **giving up on the permissions** granted to your original account

## IAM Permission Boundaries

Effective permissions = Orgnization SCP & Permission Boundary(Role, User but not a Group) & identify based policy (Role, User, Group)

## IAM Policy Evaluation Logic

Deny evaluation -> Orgnization SCP -> Resource based Policy -> Identify based policy -> IAM permission boundaries -> Session Policies

## AWS Directory Services

- AWS Managed Microsoft AD
	- The user base is stored on **Both ends** - On premise AD, AWS Managed AD
	- So **Either end can authenticate**
- AD Connector
	- Only On premise AD can authenticate
- Simple AD
	- You don't have a On-premise AD, but solely using AWS Directory Service

## AWS Control Tower

- for controlling the **Multi-account, AWS environment** with **GuardRails**
- **Preventive Guardrails** - Based on SCP
- **Detective Guardrails** - Based on **AWS Config**


## For exam

- A Prod and Dev environment, both need to be audited ->
	- Create an AWS orgnization + 2 OUs (PROD, DEV)
	- Apply SCP to OU
- How to **restrict API calls from specific AWS region**? ->
	- specify `aws:RequestedRegion` in the policy
- EventBridge to configure Lambda as a target ->
	- Resource based policy (additionally, other services **Lambda, SNS, SQS, Cloudwatch logs, API Gateway**)
- EventBridge to configure Kinesis Data Stream as a target ->
	- Identify based policy
