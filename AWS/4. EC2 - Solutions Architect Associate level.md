## Private IP vs Public IP vs Elastic IP

- public ip must be unique on the internet, and can be geo-located easily
- private ip must be unique in its own private network
	- machines connects to the internet with the aid of a proxy = internet gateway
	- only a specific IP range can be private IPs
- elastic IP
	- public IP that **re-assigned** upon stopping and starting an EC2 instance
	- elastic IP is like a fixed IP address can be attached to an EC2 instance
	- you only have **5 elastic ip** per account, by yeah, you can ask aws to increase the amount
	- **Not recommended to use elastic IP**
		 - reflect poor architecture design
		 - take random IP and **register a DNS name to it**
		 - or use a **load balancer + private IP of ec2 instance**
==TODO: from the hands-on, that elastic IP can be assigned to **a network interface** or a **instance**, what is network interface, and how is the usage?==

## Placement groups

- it is about how you want the EC2 instance to be located, and we apply the strategy through a placement group
- startegies:
	- cluster
		- in **same rack (same hardware)** within a **single AZ**
		- hence low network latency across the instances
	- spread
		- in **different rack** and in **different AZ**
		- spread instances across underlying hardware (max 7 instances per group per AZ), for critical application
	- partition
		- a partition = **a few instances in a same rack**
		- we have **multiple partitions** in an AZ
		- we spread partitions in **different AZs**
		- can be scaled up to 100 of instances per group
		- get partition info from metadata, and use cases are for partition-aware applications: HDFS, HBase, Cassandra, Kafka

## Elastic Network Interface (ENI)

- **logical component** in a **VPC** represents a **virtual network card**
- an EC2 can have one primary private IPV4, one or more secondary private IPV4 ==TODO: to check why== : [explains here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-elastic-network-interfaces-in-the-virtual-private-cloud/)
- each ENI has:
	- one elastic IPv4
	- one or more **security groups**
	- created independently from EC2 instance, and then attach to it
	- bound to an AZ, more specific a **subnet**
	- good for **failover**, so the same ENI can be re-attached to the failed over instance

## Ec2 hibernate

- Stop - state of ec2 instance is kept
- terminate - state are destroyed
- start:
	- first start - OS boots, user data script is run
	- succeeding start - OS boots
-  hibernate:
	- OS is not restart, state is kept in **Memory** (underlying, RAM state is written to a file, in **root** ebs, and the EBS must be **encrypted**)
	- has to be **enabled explicitly in setting**
