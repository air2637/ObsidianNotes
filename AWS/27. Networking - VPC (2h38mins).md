## Public vs Private IPs in IPV4

Private ip can be:
- 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (aka 10.0.0.0/8 -> 1 octet is fixed) -> for a big private network
- In **AWS default VPC**, the range instead become 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (aka 172.16.0.0/12)
- Home networks - 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16)

**All the rest IP addresses not in above 3 ranges are public IP addresses**

## Default VPC

- IP range
- Route Table
	- possibly to have 0.0.0.0 targets to a **internet gateway** which is to give **Internet access**
- ACL
- Subnets
	- Subnet has not route table assigned so it uses the main Route table of the VPC (implicitly)

## VPC

- Max 5 CIDR per VPC and for each CIDR, min size 16 (AKA /28) and max size 65536 (AKA /16)
- **You need to ensure VPC CIDR not overlap with your other networks**

## Subnets

- 5 IP addresses are reserved in each subnet (first 4 + last 1), which can NOT be assigned to EC2 instance, for example.
	- 1st Network Address
	- 2nd For VPC Router
	- 3rd for mapping to Amazon provided DNS
	- 4th for future use ...
	- last for Network Broadcast Address
- Creating subnets in a VPC:
	- you assign subnet to a specific AZ, and you can add various subnets to different AZs in a VPC
	- For subnet intended for public internet facing (reserve less IP address , e.g. /24 -> so 256 address), and normally ALB are placed in the subnet
	- For subnet intended for private network you can allocate more IP addressed e.g. /20
	- **Make sure no overlap in subnets within the same VPC**
	- But so far without the aid from **Internet Gateway** no essential difference between the subnets you have reserved! -> A subnet is deemed to be a **Public subnet** only if it **direct its traffic to the internet gateway** with the help of a **Route table**

## Internet Gateway

- for allowing resources in a VPC to connect to internet
- it scales **horizontally**, it is not a physical device but a logical one
- must be created **separately from a VPC**
- ==Golden rule== that **One VPC has on IGW** and vice versa
- IGW on itself has no internet access.. so **Route table must be edited** :
	- Route table routes 0.0.0.0/0 to IGW (you will see the private IP ranges are already targetted to **local**)
	- Associate the public subnet to this RouteTable
	- Launch an EC2 instance within this subnet, but **how about the internet access in private subnet we defined??**:
		- Bastion Host: for outside device to connect to ec2 within the private subnet of our VPC
		- NAT gateway, NAT instance: for ec2 within the private subnet of our VPC to connect to internet

## Bastion Host

- For a client from public internet to connect to an EC2 instance residing in a VPC and in a Private subnet:
	- a proxy host (bastion host) setup in public subnet that allows connection from the client IP address, port 22 maybe.
	- the connection from bastion host and the target ec2 needs to **allow the IP/ SG of the bastion host** allowed as they are within the same VPC
 - So Bastion Host for the proxy sitting in public subnet for incoming connection, in contrast to **NAT instance**

## NAT Instance (Not NAT Gateway)

- NAT = Network Address Translation
- To allow EC2 instances in private subnets to connect to the internet
- So the NAT needs to 
	1. reside in the public subnet,
	2. with **disabled source/destination check** 
	3. attached with **elastic IP**
	4. route table configured to route traffic from private subnet to the NAT

## NAT Gateway

- AWS managed instance while NAT instance just a generic ec2 instance managed by you
- again, NAT Gateway instance you need to launch it within a Public subnet
- Edit route table that sending internet traffic out to the NAT Gateway
- Private Subnet -> NAT Gateway -> Internet Gateway

## Security Group vs. NACLs

- Security Group is stateful, while NACLs is stateless ->  stateful means if the traffic is allowed to come in, it is allowed to go out; while stateless means both inbound and outbound must be granted explicitly
- SG is at instance level while NACLs are at **subnet level**
- SG only support ALLOW rule, as it defaults all DENIED; while NACLs support both ALLOW and DENY rules, default is blank

## VPC Peering

- for two(you will understand I deliberately saying two here later) VPCs from **different account**/ **different region** to connect
- the connectivity is **NOT transitive**, VPC A peering with VPC B, and VPC B peering with VPC C, does not grant us the connectivity between VPC A and VPC C
- **NO overlap of CIDRs** between the peering VPCs
- After peering successful, you can reuse the SG from one VPC in another
- Operationally in AWS, that you need to add the peering connection in route table in each targetted VPC to make the peering succeed

## VPC Endpoint

*EC2 instance in private subnet of a VPC to connect to AWS service e.g. S3, SNS etc*

- without a VPC Endpoint (needs to go through internet path)
	1. the ec2 instance connects to a **NAT Gateway** for outbound traffic
	2. the NAT Gateway then needs to re-direct the traffic to **Internet Gateway**	
	3. call the API of the AWS service via www
- with a VPC Endpoint
	1. the ec2 instance connects to a **VPC Endpoint**
	2. then it calls the API of the aws service directly within the **AWS PrivateLink**

## VPC Flow Logs

- Capture info about IP traffic going into below interfaces:
	- VPC
	- Subnet
	- ENI
- the info contains:account id, interface id, src addr, dest addr, src port, dest port, action (Accept / Reject)


# For on-premise Data centre to connect to AWS VPC

*2 options are available:*
- S2S VPN (limited by the bandwidth, as it goes through public network)
- Connect Direct (private network, while it has not encryption over the network, unless you use S2S VPN on top of Connect Direct)

For the comparison of the options: https://www.stormit.cloud/blog/comparison-aws-direct-connect-vs-vpn/

## AWS Site to Site VPN (S2S VPN)

*for connection between the VPC in AWS and another network e.g. Corporate Data Centre*

You need 2 components:
- VPN Gateway (VGW) sitting in the VPC of AWS
- Customer Gateway (CGW) sitting in the Corporate Data Centre
	- which IP address to ping?
		- if the Customer Gateway has a public IP address, use it 
		- if not, use NAT device's public IP address (what the hell is this ??)
	- Don't forget to **Enable Propagation**

### VPN Clubhub

*you established connection between one AWS VPC to multiple S2S VPN corporate data centre, then all the corporate data centres are connected too*

## Transit Gateway

- instead of two end connection from VPC peering, we want a topology like *hub and spoke*, we use:
	- **Transit Gateway** to connect all VPCs, and 
	- route table to route the traffic to right destination
- It works with Connect Direct and S2S VPN as well:
	- help increase the bandwidth, thanks to **multi-cast** routing **ECMP**, as it establishes multiple tunnels for S2S VPN
	- help Connect Direct, in the case where on-premise DC can connect VPCs of different accounts

## Network Firewall

- firewall at sitting at VPC level, that controls traffic at:
	- VPC to VPC (VPC peering)
	- Outbound traffic
	- Inbound traffic
	- Traffic happens on **Connect Direct**, S2S VPN
- Internally, the firewall is built with Gateway Load Balancer, that inspect traffic:
	- IP, port
	- Protocol
	- domain level
- Actions: **Allow, Drop, Alert**

*So, what are the comparison among, Network Firewall, NACLs, WAF, and Security Groups?*

I address the security mechanisms in above order with a reason, which is from the outer most to inner most (or like a top-down manner).

Network Firewall:
	- VPC level
NACLs:
	- Subnet level
	- stateless
WAF:
	- application level, and sits in ALB normally
	- only control **Ingress** traffic
Security Group
	- instance level

## For exam

- **Hosted Direct Connect** supports better bandwidth over **Dedicated Direct Connect**
- **PrivateLink** is for **VPC endpoint**
- You have setup the **Internet Gateway** in the VPC, but ec2 instance still has no internet access, could be due to:
	- Route table missing the entries that directs 0.0.0.0/0 to IGW
	- EC2 instance has not public IP address (If not using a NAT Gateway, the ec2 has to resides in public subnet with a public IP address attached https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html; while if using a NAT Gateway, it is defaulted to associate with a Public IP https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html)
	- NACLs not allow outbound traffic
	- BUT **can NOT be due to SG outbound rule**, as SG is stateful, as long as SG allows inbound, it surely allows the response to outbound
 - **VPN ClubHub** is for one VPC connects to multiple corporate data centres; while **Transit Gateway** is for scaling up the bandwidth of S2S VPN connections (also for Direct Connect to have connection of VPCs from different region / account)
