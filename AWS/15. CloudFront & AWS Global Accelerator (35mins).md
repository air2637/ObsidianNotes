## CloudFront

- For ==Content Delivery Network==
- **the cache location that nearest to your requesting location**
- Improve read performance, as the content is cached at the **Edge locations** (also seen [[13. Advanced Amazon S3(25mins)#S3 performance]])
- AWS continuously adding edge locations globally
- DDos protection (because worldwide), integration with Shield, AWS Web application firewall
- Origins can be:
	- s3 bucket
	- custom origin (Http backed, and required **Public IP**)
		 - ALB
		 - EC2 instance

## CloudFront vs S3 Cross Region Replication

- CloudFront:
	- Global edge network
	- file are cached for a **TTL (maybe a day)**
	- Great for static content that must be available everywhere
- S3 Cross Region Replication [[12 Amazon S3 Introduction (47mins)#S3 Replication (CRR, SRR)]]
	- You need to setup the specific region desired
	- Files are updated in near real-time
	- **Read only**
	- Great for **dynamic content** that accessed in **low-latency** in specific regions

##  Geo Restriction

- you can either **Allowlist** or **Blocklist** users from accessing your **Cloudfront distributions** based on their IP geo locations
- use case:
	- copyrights to control access to content sensitive to geo locations

## Cache Invalidation

- We can force an **entire or partial** cache refresh before its TTL

## Global Accelerator

### use case in non-global accelerator
1. You deployed app that has global users accessing it directly
2. they need to go over the **public internet** which adds lots of latency due to **many hops**
3. we want to let it go through AWS network to **minimise latency**

### Unicast IP vs. Anycast IP
- Unicast - one server holds one IP address
- AnyCast - all serves hold the same IP address, and the client is routed to the nearest one

### How global accelerator help [[#use case in non-global accelerator]]
- instead hopping over public internet, leverage on **edge location**
- by using **Anycast IP**, the traffic is routed to the edge location nearest to client
- benefits:
	- intelligent routing to lowest latency and fast regional failover
	- no client cache (as it loads content from a fixed Anycast IP)
	- traffic through AWS network
	- health checks
