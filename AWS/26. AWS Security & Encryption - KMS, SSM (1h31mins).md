## Key management Service (KMS)

- AWS managing the encryption key for us with KMS
- CloudTrail to track the usage of each of the keys in KMS
- Types of KMS keys
	- Symmetric (Same key used to encrypted and decrypted content)
	- Asymmetric (Public key for encryption and Private key for decryption)
		- Use it for client-side decryption
- A KMS Key can be:
	- owned by AWS itself
	- managed by AWS
	- managed by Customer - **CMK**
- Key rotation - automated every 1 year
- Use cases:
	1. Copying EBS snapshot across regions:
		1. In region 1, EBS is encrypted with a KMS key A
		2. EBS snapshot is encrypted with the KMS key A
		3. the snapshot for copying is **Re-encrypted with a Global KMS key B**
		4. in region 2, the snapshot is decrypted with the key B
		5. the snapshot is reloaded
- who can access the key?
	- default: everyone can access
	- custom key policy: you tell who can access

### KMS Multi-region key

- Primary key in region 1 and replicated keys in other regions
	- No need to re-encrypt or making cross-region API calls
	- the replicated key is managed **independently**
- Only use case - client side encryption:
	- DynamoDB **Global table** client side encryption with multi-region key, e.g Customer Social Security No.

### S3 Replication & Encryption

- S3 objects with Custom KMS will never be replicated
- S3 with SSE-KMS, you need to enable these for replication:
	- Specify the key, s3 object
	- Proper Key policy
	- IAM `kms:Decrypt` in source, `kms:Encrypt`  in target

### Sharing AMI from account A to account B

1. AMI is encrypted in account A by KMS key
2. MUST modify the AMI attribute to add **Launch permission** in target account B
3. Share the KMS key 
4. Account B has proper permission to `DescribeKey`, `ReEncrypted`, `CreateGrant`, `Decrypt`

## AWS SSM vs Secret Manager

- Both can store credentials, while Secret Manager is more specialised, given it has the capability to **force rotation of secrets every X days**
- Secret Manager more integrated with RDS
- Secret Manager supports multi-region replication

## ACM (Aws Certificate Manager)

- Provision, manage and deploy TLS Certificates
- In-flight encryption for websites (HTTPS)
- Support **Public and private TLS certificates**
- Automatic renewal (60 days before expiry)
- Integrated with Elastic Load Balancers, CloudFront Distributions, APIs on API Gateway
- **NOT support for invocation from EC2**

### EventBridge to notify before expiry

- Option 1: Configure directly to ACM to send in X days prior to certificate expiry (backed by EventBridge)
- Option 2: AWS config rule to scan and to notify EventBridge to send alert

## AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)

-  sits at Layer 7 (HTTP), protect application from common exploits
- deployed to:
	- **ALB specifically**
	- API gateway
	- CloudFront
	- AppSync GraphQL API
	- Cognito User Pool
- through defining **WEB ACL (Web Access Control List) Rules** (regional, but cloudfront is global)
	- IP set
	- HTTP headers, body, or URI string - SQL injection, Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
	- Size constraints, geo-match (block countries)
	- Rate based rules (to count occurrences of events) - DDoS protection
 
## GuardDuty

- **Anomaly detection** based on machine learning
- Data being scanned can be:
	- CloudTrail logs
		- CloudTrail Management Events - create VPC subnets etc
		- CloudTrail Data Events - get objects, list objects etc
	- VPC flow logs
		- Unusual internal traffic, unusual IP address
	- DNS logs
	- Kubernetes Audit logs
 - Output will be sent to **EventBridge** for notifications

## Amazon Inspector

- **EC2 instance**- checked by SSM (System Manager) agent on:
	- unintended network accessibility
	- OS vulnerabilities
- Container images **pushed to ECR**
- **Lambda function** to be deployed
- Output the alert to **AWS Security Hub**

## Amazon Macie

**Detect sensitive data** stored in **S3** based on machine learning


## For Exam

- You created a CMK (Customer managed Key) in KMS, and you need to rotate the key every 3 months -> You need to **Rotate the key manually**, create a new CMK, and use **Key Aliases** to reference. **Keep the old key so you can decrypt the old data**.
- You have a **secret value** and you need to **track** the value over time -> use **SSM Parameter Store**
- You want the protection from DDoS attack and **Bill reimbursement** for incurred costs during the attach -> **AWS Shield Advanced**
- What **GuardDuty** scans ? -> **CloudTrail logs, VPC flow logs, DNS logs**
- To **centrally manage Security Groups and AWS Shield Advanced** **Across all accounts** -> **AWS Firewall Manager**
- To **replicate** s3 objects from one bucket to another but **encrypted with a different KMS key** -> You need to grant **Source KMS key** with `kms:Decrypt` and **Target KMS key** with `kms:Encrypt`

- To enable in-flight encryption we need? -> **HTTPS** endpoint + SSL cetificate
- Do you need to **create KMS key** before use the encryption feature for **EBS, S3, RDS** ? -> **NO!!**
- To control the **access to your KMS CMK keys**? -> **KMS key policy** , not IAM Policy
- **Aurora client-side encryption** + **Multi-region key** to achieve client side data encryption to DB and globally access
