## CloudWatch Logs Subscription

- A filter that you can apply to CloudWatch logs and send the result to a destination
- The candidate for destination:
	- Lambda -> Amazon OpenSearch
	- Kinesis Data Firehose
	- Kinesis Data Stream -> Lambda

### CloudWatch Logs Aggregation - Multi-account & Multi-regions

- CloudWatch (Account, Region Specific) -> **Subscription Filter** -> Kinesis Data Stream -> xxx

### CloudWatch Agent

- a programme that pushes logs from EC2 to CloudWatch
- Metrics (==More granular==)
	- CPU
	- Disk - IO, utility
	- RAM
	- Netstat
	- Processes
	- Swap Space

### CloudWatch Alarm 

- Targets
	- Stop, terminate, reboot an EC2
	- EC2 Auto Scaling
	- SNS
- Composite Alarm
	- AND, OR for combination in triggering an alarm
	- It helps reduce the noise
 - You can trigger the alarm manually - for testing purpose  `set-alarm-state` 


## EventBridge

What can be the event?
- Scheduled cron job - every one hour, trigger a lambda function
- Event patterns - e.g. When a user is signed in, send an email etc

What can be the source of those event?
- AWS services
- 3rd party
- **Custom Event bus**o

## CloudTrail

- It tracks the history of **events/ API calls** within your AWS account


## CloudWatch vs CloudTrail vs Config

- CloudWatch
	- performance monitoring with metric defined
	- Events, logs, alerts
- CloudTrail
	- API calls made within AWS account (tracks account activity related to **actions across aws infra**)
	- trails for specific resource
- Config
	- Record configuration changes
	- Evaluate resources against **compliance rules**


## For exam

- capture DB log with keyword 'Error' -> 
	- **CloudWatch Logs Metric Filter** to capture 'Error' keyword
	- **CloudWatch Alarm** triggers based on the **Metric Filter**
- To monitor the **Memory** usage of EC2 ->
	- **Unified CloudWatch Agent** to push the memory usage to CloudWatch
- make a configuration change and **evaluate the performance** ->
	- **CloudWatch** (metric more specifically?)
- Someone has **terminated** an EC2, we need to find who and when ->
	- **CloudTrail**
- CloudTrail has been enabled, and you want to find **unusual activity** ->
	- **CloudTrail Insight**(fyi, besides this type, the other two are CloudTrail Data Event, CloudTrail Management Events)
 - The EC2 has been terminated **4 months ago**, you have the setup of **CloudTrail sending logs to S3** ->
	 - **Athena** to query the logs in S3 (**CloudTrail log retention max 3 month**)
  - You found the port 84 is wrongly exposed, you want to keep monitor the port in case someone expose it again ->
	- setup **Config Rules**
- You want to **evaluate the compliance of your resources over time** ->
	- **AWS Config**
- SG is loose on SSH port, you want **AWS config to auto reconfigure the SG** to correct state ->
	- **AWS Config Remediations**
- You want to be **Notified when someone changing the SG** ->
	- **AWS Config Notification**
- You got spike on HTTP requests, you want to find out **Top IP addressed** making the requests ->
	- **CloudWatch Contributor Insights**
 - Need to store **EventBridge events** every 6 months, and the events **need to be stored and used later on** ->
	 - **EventBridge Archive + Replay feature**
