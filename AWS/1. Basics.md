## Regions

 - Region 1...N Availability Zones, e.g. Sydney ap-southeast-2
	 - ap-southeast-2a
	 - ap-southeast-2b
	 - etc
 - Name can be us-west-1, eu-west-3
 - A region is a **Cluster of data centres**
 - **Most AWS resources are region-scoped**
 - Choosing the region:
	 - compliance to any restriction e.g. from gov
	 - latency
	 - Not all regions having all services
	 - Pricing diff between regions

## Availability Zone

- each AZ = one or more **Discrete data centres**
- so they're **isolated from disasters**
- however, they're connected with **high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking** 

## Global services (not constrained by region)

- IAM (Identify and Access Management)
- Route 53 - DNS services
- CouldFront - Content Delivery Network
- WAF - Web application firewall
The rest are **Region-scoped** services
