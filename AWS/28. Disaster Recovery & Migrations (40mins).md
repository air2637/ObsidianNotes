## Disaster Recovery Options

Measurements:
	- RPO: a point between RPO and Disaster Happening -> caused data loss
	- RTO: a point between Disaster Happening and Data fully recovered -> caused delay in time
*So we want minimise both RPO and RTO*

Backup and restores:
	- cheap and simple
	- but high RPO

Pilot light:
- A smaller instance running together with the main instance
- so in disaster happening, it failed over to the smaller instance
- e.g. Route 53 to do the failover, and Data replicated between on-prem DB to RDS

Warm standby:
- similar to Pilot light, but this is a full system, including all components from app to DB is running together
- but still smaller in scale / compute power

Multi site/ Hot site
- Full production scale is running both AWS and On-premise

All AWS multi region
- fully on AWS cloud
