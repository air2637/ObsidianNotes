## WhatsTheTime.com - stateless web app

- Stateless app (e.g. No DB required)

### Day1
- User wants to know time from our **Public EC2** of **instance type of T2**  hosting the app, with an **elastic IP address**

### Day2
- More user (more traffic) comes, so **Vertical scaling** is adopted - upgrading the ec2 instance to **instance type of M5**
- We understands the limitations:
	- server has to be down for the vertical scaling

### Day3
- Even more traffic comes, so **Horizontal scaling** is adopted - adding more ec2 instance of type M5
- Limitations:
	- User has to keep note of new IP addressed assigned to each new ec2 instance (server)

### Day4

- Let user just to visit the site with a static domain name
	- Keep the ec2 instances still **public facing** (allows public https inbound traffic), but remove their elastic IP addresses
	- **Route 53 to register type A record with  TTL of 1 hour with record value pointing to the IP address**  ==TODO: private IP address??==
		> The IP address can be changed, but it does not matter, as the Route 53 will sync up the changes -- from the course
  - If we remove one instance, because TTL is set to 1 hour, the users previously connected to the "gone" instance will be disconnected in the 1 hour

### Day5

- Add a **public ELB**, make EC2 instance as **Private**, restrict **Security Group Rule** so traffics are allowed between ELB and private EC2 instances
- DNS service to associate the domain name to **Alias record** of value of the ELB address, **as ELB ip changes overtime!!** [[10. Route 53 (1h20min)#CNAME vs Alias]]
- ELB enabled with **Health Check**, so ELB can route traffic to alive instances only
- Even further, we add **Auto scaling group** to the set of EC2 instances, so to scale up with more instances during daytime when more traffic expected, and scale down with less instances during nighttime when less traffic expected.
- Limitation - **Missing of Disaster recovery** as all instances are set up in a single **Availability Zone**

### Day6

- **Setting up instances in multiple AZs**, keep in mind that both ALB and ASG support multi AZs :
	- load balancing as [[8. High Availability and Scalability- ELB, ASG#Cross Zone Load Balancing]], 
	- [ASG multi zone support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-add-availability-zone.html) (AZ is identified by subnet)
- For cost concern, as we know the WhatsTheTime.com should always running, we decide to understand the **Minimum capacity**, and start **Reserved instances**  for cost saving - [[3. EC2 Fundamentals#EC2 instances purchasing options]]

### Take aways

- Public vs private IP and EC2 instances
- Elastic IP vs Route 53 vs Load balancer
- Autoscaling group over manual setup
- Multi-AZ to survive disasters
- ELB health check
- Security Group rules
- Reserve capacity for cost saving

## Five pillars of solution architecture design:
- Cost
- Performance
- Reliability
- Security
- Operational Excellence

## MyColthes.com - stateful web app

- Requirements:
	- shopping cart - so user data needs to be stored
	- hundreds of users at the same time - performance, availability concerns
	- for ease of scale and to keep web app as stateless as possible
	- user should have their details info stored in DB
- Prior to course, my own answer:
	- Route 53 with DNS record registering to a ALB
	- ALB load balances to multi ec2 in multi AZs
	- ec2 are managed by ASG
	- RDS cross AZs
	- elastiCache to keep user state

### Day1

- Route 53 with alias record to ALB
- ALB load balances to EC2 instances across mult-AZs
- To keep user state consistent e.g. user's shopping cart items:
	- Option 1 - add **Session Affinity** - ELB stickiness, so user previously routed to ec2 instance A will be kept routed to the same instance, refer to [[8. High Availability and Scalability- ELB, ASG#Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)]]
	- Option 2 - user stores the **cookies** in web browser:
		- request data becomes heavy, however, cookies size < 4 kb
		- security concern as the cookies are freed to be modified from client's end, so application logic to validate the cookies has to be in place.
	- Option 3 - **ElastiCache** to save details with retrieval key e.g. session ID which is sent from client

### Day2

- we decide to adopt Option 3 in Day1,
- To separate the Reads and Writes -> **Scaling Reads**:
	- Option 1 - add RDS master (write operations) + RDS read replicas (read only operations)
	-  Option 2 - **Lazy loading** with ElastiCache:
		- the new request is load from RDS operational DB, and save into ElastiCache as well
		- 2nd time same request will directly returned from ElastiCache
- Multi-AZs on components:
	- ALB
	- ASG for ec2 instances
	- RDS
	- ElastiCache
- Security Concerns:
	- Restrict traffic to EC2 Security Group from ALB only
	- Restrict traffic to ElastiCache SG from EC2's SG
	- Restrict traffic to RDS SG from EC2's SG

### Take aways

- ELB sticky sessions
- client cookies
- ElastiCache - storing session with key (session ID), caching data from RDS for scaling reads, multi AZs
- RDS - storing data, read replicas for scaling reads, multi AZs
- Tight security with SGs
- Typical 3 tier solution - client, web, DB

## MyWordPress.com - Stateful web app

- Requirements:
	- fully scalable
	- access and display picture uploaded
	- user data, blog content should be stored in Mysql DB

 ### Day1
 
-  Image stored in EBS, and attached to one EC2 instance, but this is problematic, as in load balancing design, the EBS is not accessible by other EC2 instances
- So we now use **EFS** with **ENI**s to support **multi-attach**, 
	- refer to [[7. EC2 instance storage#EFS - Elastic File System]] , and though EBS of io class also supports multi-attach, but not fit for current use case for cost concern [[7. EC2 instance storage#Multi-attach]]
	- ENI refer to [[4. EC2 - Solutions Architect Associate level#Elastic Network Interface (ENI)]] ==Damn! I don't know that ENI has to be attached for EFS multi-attach: ==
		- [EFS needs **mount target** which is an ENI, exposes EFS to your VPC](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71461931)
- DB wise use Aurora for easy Multi AZ, Read replicas

### Take aways ###

- Aurora DB to have easy multi AZs, read replicas
- Storing data in EBS - single instance application 
- Storing data in EFS - distributed instances applications

## How to instantiating application quickly

- launching full stacks:
	- intall applications
	- load initial data sets
	- configure everything in infra
	- launch application
- ==So how to do all these quickly??==
	- Use a **Golden AMI** - you bake everything into an AMI:
		- install the required apps
		- OS dependencies
		- then only launch the EC2 instance from this golden AMI
	- Bootstrap with User Data
		- a bit slow
		- but good fit for dynamic configurations, e.g. configuring instance's specific url db string
	- Hybrid (Golden AMI + User Data) -> **Elastic Beanstalk**
	- RDS - restore from a snapshot >> running big data insertion script!
	- Similarly, EBS - restore from a snapshot

## Beanstalk

- Developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS, Developer only care the application development, leave the rest auto managed, leveraging **CloudFormation** as the backend 
	- capacity provisioning
	- load balancing
	- scaling
	- application health monitoring
	- instance configurations etc
 - Support of Web server tier and Work environment tier:
	 - web server tier: client , web, db
	 - work environment tier: sqs + worker ec2 instance
- Support multiple environments:
	- PROD: proper setup of all infra components
	- Dev: single instance for testing features
