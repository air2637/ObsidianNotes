# Amazon RDS

- Automated provisioning ([[#Auto scaling]]), OS patching 
- Continuous backups, restore to specific timestamp
- monitoring in dashboards
- [[#Read replicas]] for improved read performance
- Multi AZ setup for DR
- Maintenance windows for upgrades
- Scaling vertical and horizontal
- Storage backed by EBS (gp 2 or io 1)


## Auto scaling

Increase storage on your RDS DB instance dynamically:
- free storage is <= 10% of allocated storage
- low storage lasts at least 5 minutes
- 6 hours have passed since last modification

## Read replicas

- Up to 5 Read Replicas
- Setup:
	- Within AZ (free of charge), and it is **Async** (eventually consistent)
	- For DR - Cross AZ (free of charge), and it is **Sync**
		- One DNS name - so automatic app failover, no manual intervention
		- **Need explicit select the option to set the Replica as DR**
	- Cross Region (pay for the network cost)
- Replicas can be promoted to their own DB (==TODO: So it becomes DR??==)
- Use cases:
	- transaction read / writes to normal DB
	- analytical activities done through the Replica with **Read only**
- Modify RDS from single AZ to Multi-AZ
	- just click on "modify" for the database
	- internally:
		- a snapshot is taken
		- a new DB is restored from the snapshot in a new AZ
		- **Sync** established between the 2 DB from each AZ

## RDS Custom

- RDS managed by AWS, while RDS Custom is on your own
- For Oracle, Microsoft SQL with **OS, db customisation**
- You can setup SSH which RDS does not provide
- Remember to:
	- **De-activate automation mode**
	- **Take a snapshot before**

## Amazon Aurora

- Amazon proprietary technology
- works for Postgres, Mysql with better performance
- Failover in Aurora is instantaneous, cloud native
- like "ALB": **Writer Endpoint, Reader Endpoint**:
	  - App connects to Writer Endpoint to write to Master DB 
	  - App connects to Reader Endpoint to read from Replicas
- Auto scaling: Reader endpoints get extended to more new Replicas
- Custom Endpoints: Rather than using the default Reader Endpoint, Custom Endpoint is used, and it allows you to connect to a subset of the underlying Replicas
- Serverless
	- No capacity planning required, as it is managed by **Proxy Fleet**
- Multi-master
	- For immediate failover for write node(rather than normally 5 mins for non-Aurora)
- Global Aurora
	- Define one primary Region
	- Add secondary region
- Aurora Machine Learning
