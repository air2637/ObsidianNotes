# Why Amazon RDS over deployed DB on EC2

- Automated provisioning ([[#Storage Auto scaling]]), OS patching 
- Continuous backups, restore to specific timestamp
- monitoring in dashboards
- [[#Read replicas]] for improved read performance
- Multi AZ setup for DR
- Maintenance windows for upgrades
- Scaling vertical and horizontal
- Storage backed by EBS (gp 2 or io 1)


## Storage Auto scaling

Increase storage on your RDS DB instance dynamically:
- free storage is <= 10% of allocated storage
- low storage lasts at least 5 minutes
- 6 hours have passed since last modification

## Read replicas

- Up to 5 Read Replicas
- Use cases:
	- transaction read / writes to normal DB
	- analytical activities done through the Replica with **Read only**
- Async for read replica:
	- Within region (free of charge), and it is **Async** (eventually consistent)
	- **Cross Region** (pay for the network cost)
- Replicas can be promoted to their own DB 
- Modify RDS from single AZ to Multi-AZ
	- just click on "modify" for the database
	- internally:
		- a snapshot is taken
		- a new DB is restored from the snapshot in a new AZ
		- **Sync** established between the 2 DB from each AZ
- In contrast to Read Replica, we want Disaster Recovery- Cross AZ (free of charge), and it is **Sync**
	- One DNS name - so automatic app failover, no manual intervention

## RDS Custom

- RDS managed by AWS, while RDS Custom is on your own
- For Oracle, Microsoft SQL with **OS, db customisation**
- You can setup SSH which RDS does not provide
- Remember to:
	- **De-activate automation mode**
	- **Take a snapshot before**

## Amazon Aurora

- Amazon proprietary technology
- works for Postgres, Mysql with better performance:
	- auto expanding storage 
	- support 15 replicas instead of 5 for normal RDS
	- Failover in Aurora is **instantaneous, cloud native**
	- High Availability , Read Scaling:
		- 6 copies of your data across 3 AZs
		- like "ALB": **Writer Endpoint, Reader Endpoint**:
			- App connects to Writer Endpoint to write to Master DB 
			- App connects to Reader Endpoint to read from Replicas
	- **Backtrack** - restore data at any point of time without using backups
- Auto scaling: Reader endpoints get extended to more new Replicas
- Custom Endpoints: **for reading operation only**, rather than using the default Reader Endpoint, Custom Endpoint is used, and it allows you to connect to a subset of the underlying Replicas
- Serverless
	- No capacity planning required, as it is managed by **Proxy Fleet**
- Multi-master
	- Every node does read and write
	- immediate failover on writer nodes
- Global Aurora - help decreasing latency for connection from desired region
	- Define one primary Region
	- Add secondary region
- Aurora Machine Learning

## RDS backups

- automated backups:
	- daily full backup
	- transaction logs are backup by RDS every 5 mins
	- retention period from 1 to 35 days
- manual DB snapshots - retention period as long as you want
- You still pay for a **stopped DB**, so for saving cost - take snapshot, and restore instead
- How to restore?
	- snapshot -> restore on a new RDS instance
	- create backup on your on-premise DB -> store it on s3 -> backup from s3

# RDS & Aurora Security

- At rest encryption - data is encrypted on the volume:
- In-flight encryption - TLS ready by default for all
- IAM authentication for connecting to DB, in addition to password login
- NO SSH enabled, except RDS custom
- Audit log can be enabled

# RDS proxy

- Improve the efficiency - Instead connecting to the instance, connecting to a proxy, which manages the connection, timeout to DB instance
- Reduced RDS & Aurora failover time
- Enforce IAM authentication
- **Not publicly accessible** - must access from VPC
- use case:
	- lambada within a VPC connects to RDS proxy in the same VPC

# ElastiCache

- Not read DB every time, but read from cache (in-memory db, high performance, low latency)
- make your application **stateless**, by saving the state into the cache
	- user login to app1, and app1 stores the session into ElastiCache
	- user login to app2, app2 retrieve the session info from ElastiCache
- to use elastiCache, needs heavy application code change:
	- application query elastiCache, if not available, read from RDS, and store into elastiCache
