## Athena

- query s3 object (CSV, JSON, ORC, Avro, Parquet) without moving it out, as it is **serverless**
- standard SQL language
- saving cost:
	- Parquet, ORC is more preferred, as it is backed by **columnar data** scanning
	- **Partition data** into multiple files
 
### Athena - Federated Query

- via **Data Source Connector** (lambda backed) to run Federated Queries for Cloudwatch, RDS, DynamoDB etc

## Redshift

- For OLAP queries, so it is specialised in datawarehousing
- **Columnar storage** instead of row based
- In contrast to Athena, that the query performances much much better, thanks to **indexes**
