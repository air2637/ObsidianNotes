## Understanding of Singleton pattern

- Ensure one and only one object of the class get created
- Access to the object which is global resource in the program
- Control the concurrent access to the resource, e.g.
	- DB one object of connection, so all transaction are sequential committed to DB
	- Logging is one object, again for ordering the log lines in sequence

Implementation:
- Generic:
	- **make the constructor private**
	- create a **static method does the object initialisation** 
		- creates one object at its first call
		- return the same object subsequently
- Python specific - as all methods in Python is public!
```Python
class MySingleton(object):

	def __new__(cls):
		if not hasattr(cls, 'instance'):
			cls.instance = super(MySingleton, cls).__new__(cls)
		return cls.instance
```
	testing with below code, and it should return same object address:
```Python
s = MySingleton()
print("get my s addresss", s)

still_s = MySingleton()
print("get my still_s address", still_s)
```
