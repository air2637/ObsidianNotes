## Understanding of Singleton pattern

- Ensure one and only one object of the class get created
- Access to the object which is global resource in the program
- Control the concurrent access to the resource, e.g.
	- DB one object of connection, so all transaction are sequential committed to DB
	- Logging is one object, again for ordering the log lines in sequence
- Lazy instantiation in the Singleton pattern
	- object may not get instantiated when `__init__` is called, but only done when really needed
- **Module level Singletons - are all Singleton by default!**

Implementation:

- Generic:
	- **make the constructor private**
	- create a **static method does the object initialisation** 
		- creates one object at its first call
		- return the same object subsequently
- Python specific - as all methods in Python is public!
```Python
class MySingleton(object):

	def __new__(cls):
		if not hasattr(cls, 'instance'):
			cls.instance = super(MySingleton, cls).__new__(cls)
		return cls.instance
```
	testing with below code, and it should return same object address:
```Python
s = MySingleton()
print("get my s addresss", s)

still_s = MySingleton()
print("get my still_s address", still_s)
```
- Lazy instantiation
```python
class Singleton:

	__instance = None

	def __init__(self):
		if not Singleton.__instance:
			print("__init__ method called.")
		else:
			print("Instance already created: ", self.getInstance())

	@classmethod
	def getInstance(cls):
		if not cls.__instance:
			cls.__instance = Singleton()
		return cls.__instance
```

==self-aid:==
- [difference between `__new__(cls,)` vs `__init__(self,)` ](https://dev.to/pila/constructors-in-python-init-vs-new-2f9j) that the `__new__` is for creating an object of the class while `__init__` is for doing any initialisation setups. That explains why `__new__` brings in `cls`, while `__init__` brings in `self`. When the latter is called, the former should already be invoked and an object is created.

- [`@classmethod` must have `cls` as its 1st parameter while `@staticmethod` do not need to](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12179752)
