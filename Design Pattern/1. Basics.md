## Object oriented

- Class
- Attributes of the Class
- Methods of the Class - responsible for manipulating the Attributes
- Each class **Instance** (object), **variable** has its own memory address

## Encapsulation
> My own words - "A Class should have a clear boundary on the accessibility of its attributes/methods."

An object's behaviour is hidden from its outside. A client can't change an object's internal state unless through the object itself.

## Polymorphism
> My own words - "A Class should define its own flexibility on accepting commands."

Two types:
- An object provide different implementations of methods based on input parameters, e.g. the '+' operator allows concatenation of two strings / math addition of two numbers
- The same interface used by objects of different types, e.g. the index syntax allows access of its element regardless it is a list / tuple / string
```python
a = "test string"
b = [1,2,3]
c = (1,2,3)
print(a[1], b[1], c[1])
```
## Inheritance
> My own words - "A Class should allow its child (resemble) class to inherit the proper attributes/methods."

One Class can derive functionalities from its parent Class - Reuse / Extend. 

**Python, unlike java, supports multiple inheritance - inheriting from multiple base Classes.**

```python
class A:
	def a1(self):
		pass

class B(A):
	def b1(self):
		pass

b = B()
b.a1()
```

## Abstraction
> My own words - ~~"A Class should know how detailed it should control on the attributes/methods"~~

It abstracts the complexity of internal implementations with an Interface.

```python
class Adder:
	def __init__(self):
		self.sum = 0
	def add(self, value):
		self.sum += value

acc = Adder()
for i in range(100):
	acc.add(i)
print(acc.sum)
```

## Composition
> My own words - "A Class should allow itself be a combination of other Classes"

**An object calls its member's functions that from other modules, thereby making base functionality available across modules without inheritance.**

```python
class A(object):
	def a1(self):
		pass
class B(object):
	def b1(self):
		A().a1()

b = B()
b.b()
```

# The OO principles

### The open/close principle

**Open for extension, but Close for modifications:**
- make your class **generic** enough, so whenever you feel need to extend the behaviour of the class, you shouldn't have to change the class itself, but **rather an extending the abstract base class**.
- Advantages:
	- Existing class not modified, so **less chances of regression**
	- Maintains the **backward compatibility**

### The invasion of control principle

- A high level module should not be dependent on its lower level module, but should be decoupled with an abstraction class. 
- The details of your Class should represent the abstraction. ==TODO: what are you talking about?==
- Advantages:
	- With the abstraction layer (it acts like a hook/adaptor), so it is easy to deal with dependencies across modules

### The interface segregation principle

**Client should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.** - You only write necessary methods as the interface, no non-necessities!

Advantages:
	- Force your interface to be concise and know it should do

### The single responsibility principle

**One and only one reason can make me change the class in the world!**

- The Class/methods should do only one thing, otherwise, split it!
- Advantages:
	- If a Class has multiple functionalities, and one of which needs to be modified, its dependent class will have to suffer the risk of this change! So the single responsibility helps avoiding this case

### The substitution principle

The derived class must be able to completely substitute the base class. ==TODO: what ? why?==

- When write a derived class, it should extend the base class. ==TODO: what a 废话==
- The derived class should be as close to the base class as possible, so that derived class itself should replace the base class without any code changes ==TODO: So it means only put its own blood as the child of base class, not 'someone' partially resemble?== 

# The concepts of Design Pattern
- Origin
	- *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software, Erich Gamma and etc*
	- Solution of completeness:
		- design
		- scalability
		- reuse
		- memory utilisation
		- etc
	- It is about **learning from others' successes rather than your own failures**.
- Advantages
	- Thoughts/Solutions are reusable across projects
	- architectural level of problem solving
	- time tested , well proven
- Taxonomy
	- Snippet vs Design vs Standard vs **Pattern**
- Thought framework:
	- Classes are the **participants**
	- Know the criticalness of **Non-functional requirements** , e.g. memory optimisation etc
	- be mindful about the **trade offs** when opting one design pattern against another
	- always need to ensure the design pattern **result** must meet the objective


## Classifying patterns

### Creational patterns

- define how objects can be created
- isolate the details of object creation
- "Code is independent of the type of object to be created" ==TODO: don't understand==
- E.g. The Singleton pattern

### Structural patterns

- define the structure of objects and classes so that they can **compose to achieve larger result**
- focus on how to **simplify the structure** and **identify the relationship of classes and objects**
- mainly leverage on **inheritance** and **composition**
- e.g. the Adapter pattern

### Behavioural patterns 

- Concerned with **interaction among objects**
- Objective is to make object **loosely coupled** but still be able to interact
- e.g. the Observer pattern
