# What is a Pod essentially?

a Pod is actually a special type of container called a "pause container" -- So ==containers running inside of Pods are really containers running inside of containers==!

so container essentially namespaces in Linux kernel (?? recalling from docker deep dive knowledge, need to confirm)

As a request, it shares:
- net namespace: IP address, port range, routing table...
- pid namespace: isolated process tree
- mnt namespace: filessystems and volumes
- UTS namespace: Hostname
- IPS namespace: Unix domain sockets and shared memory

# Why need Pod wrapper for container?

## 1. Pods augment containers

- Labels and annotations
	- Group pods and associate them with other objects
	- Integrate with 3rd party tools and services (??)
- Restart policies
- Probes: e.g. startup probes, liveness probes etc
- Affinity and anti-affinity rules
	Over which nodes that Pods are allowed to run in the cluster
- Termination control
- Security policies
- Resource requests and limits
	Specify min/max values for things like CPU, memory, diskIO etc

## 2. Pods assisting in scheduling

## 3. Pods enable resource sharing

- Shared filesystem
- Shared network stack (IP address, routing tables, ports ...)
- Shared memory
- Shared volume


# Deploying Pods

## Via a controller or not

| feature | via a Pod manifest | via a controller |  
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |  
| self-healing, scaling, rolling updates | No | Yes(^1) |

Note:
1. Kubelet will attempt local restarts and if it still fails, controller observing the failure and start a replacement Pod on a different worker node (so, a different IP, UID) -> so ==store data and state outside the pod!==


## Process

1. Define it in a manifest file
2. post the YAML to API server
3. API server authenticates and authorises the request
4. validate the manifest file
5. Scheduler deploys the Pod to a healthy node
6. Local kubelet monitors it (Controller will monitor it too if deployment via a controller)

## Short-lived vs. long-lived Pods

| | Short-lived | Long-lived |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Controller Types | Deployments, StatefulSets, DamonSets | Jobs, Cronjobs |

## Multi-containers Pod

1. Sidecar multi-container Pods
2. Adapter multi-container Pods
3. Ambassador multi-container Pods
4. Init multi-container Pods


# Pod Network

1. For a multi-container Pod, all the containers in a Pod share same IP address, but differentiated by the port number; inter-container communication is via "localhost"
2. Pod network is *flat* -- meaning Pod can tale directly to every other Pod without the need for complex routing and port mapping.

# Multi-container Pod

## Patterns
- Sidecar : along with main container, the sidecar container does secondary tasks. e.g. service mesh, where the sidecars do task like encrypt traffic etc.
	 - Adapter: a specific variation from Sidecar pattern, that the sidecar does job like transforming the output from main container into format that acceptable by receivers..
	- Ambassador: [dont really know what is the diff from Adapter mode]
- Init: the init container does the bootstrap task before the main container can successfully start. So init container only run once.
