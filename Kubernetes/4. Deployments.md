> Two major components for deployment: The spec , The controller

### Deployment Spec
> Declarative YAML file describes the desired state of a stateless app

### Deployment Controller
> Takes the Deployment Spec, running on control plane, keeps reconciling observed state with desired state

### Static pod as the opposite
1. create a stateless app
2. package it as a container
3. define it in a Pod template
4. run it template on K8s

**No self-heal, no scale, no easy update or rollback**

### Wraps in Deployment object
1. wrap app in a container
2. wrap container in a pod: specify the labels, annotations other meta used by K8s
3. wrap pod in a deployment object: specify the scaling, self-healing (**ReplicaSets**), updates
4. API server process the Deployment Spec
5. Deployment Controller keeps monitoring it

**One Deployment object manages one pod template, but can manage multiple replicas of same pod.**


### Declarative vs. Imperative

Declarative: Just tell me the end goals
Imperative: Tell me a list of steps 

### Rolling update, and Rollback with Deployments

Zero downtime rolling-update(release) requires the app:
1. loose coupling via APIs
2. Backward & forward campatibility

Steps when a new version of app image to be deployed:
1. Deployment detects a new version specified in the Specs
2. Deployment create a new ReplicaSet, with targeted configuration
3. Deployment instructs the old ReplicaSet to gradually decrease the number of Pod instances all the way down to 0
4. But the old ReplicaSet is still kept by Deployment for rollback purpose
