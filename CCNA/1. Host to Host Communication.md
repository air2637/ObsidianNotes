## Characteristics of a Network

- Network topology
	- It is a diagram dictates how the network setup is, with devices, connections etc
- Speed vs Cost
	- always a trade off between the desire for faster network, and for lower cost
- Security
	- For preventing intrusions (what kind of intrusion it can be??)
- Availability
	- As we want our network always function, especially for mission critical components.
	- No single point of failure - so double up on those components
- Scalability
	- The network should grow as per our needs from running the business objectives **without a redesign of network topology**
- Reliability
	- um... how it is different from **availability**??

## OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model

- It is an ISO standard, serves as a framework delegating communication layers, which supports the communication between a computer to another over a network
- It is conceptual - so not a physical thing
- illustration with a sender - receiver example, where sender sends message from layer 7 to layer 1, while receiver receives the message from layer 1 to layer 7 (**Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away**)
	- layer 7 - **Application**, contains email content
	- layer 6 - **Presentation**, um.. Idk what is this for
	- layer 5 - **Session**, again, idk... but from 7 to 5 are all controlled/concerned by developers rather than network engineer
	- layer 4 - **Transport - TCP/UDP + Port info**
	- layer 3 - **Network - Source, Destination IP addresses. A device works on Network layer is a router**
	- layer 2 - **Datalink  - MAC address. If the communication is via Ethernet, A switch operates in Data Link layer**
	- layer 1 - **Physical - actual transmitting of packets, Hubs works in this layer** 

## TCP/IP model

- Another framework for dictating the layers of **Compute specifically** Host to Host communication over a network
- 4 layers:
	- **Application** - contains OSI Application, Presentation and Session layers
	- **Transport** - one to one mapping to OSI Transport layer
	- **Internet** - OSI Network layer
	- **Network Access** - OSI Data Link and Physical layer
- How to name the data unit transmitted in each layer (aka **Protocol Data Unit**)?
	- Application - **Data**
	- Transport - **Segment**, which is a unit of data during transmission **less likely incurs transmission problem**
	- Internet - **Packet**, data transmitted here could be **geographically separated**, provide info of **logical addressing**
	- Network Access - **Frame** 
- one more thing, just a convention, that we also call the PDU between the host to host a **Packet**
