## Hardware, Software makes up the Internet and networks

- **Hosts and end systems** are connected by a network of **Communication Links** and **Packet Switches** 
	- **Communications Links** are physical medias, can be coaxial cable, copper wire, optical fiber, and radio spectrum. Different links can transmit data at different **transmission rate** that in unit of bits/seconds
	- **Packet switches** can be **routers** and **link-layer switches** - both forward packets toward the destinations. Link layer switches are for accessing network, while routers used in network core
- End systems access the Internet through **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)** - the lower tier ISPs interconnected through national, international upper tier ISPs etc
- **Protocols**  - run on end systems, packet switches, controls sending, receiving info within the Internet, e.g. TCP, IP
- Understanding from **Service** angle:
	- distributed applications - run on the end system, e.g. web surfing, email etc
	- **Socket interface** - a set of rules that the sending end system must follow, so that Internet can deliver data to the destination end system. Imagine Alice writing a mail to Bob
	- **Protocol** - a convention how two devices communicate, can be applied to hardware, or software, defines **the format, order of messages exchanged between 2 or more entities, and the action taken on the transmission**

## Edge of network

- **Access network** - the network that physically connects an end system to the **first router** on a path, with **Link layer technologies**
	- **Home Access** - DSL, Cable, FTTH, 5G fixed wireless
		- DSL (at home) + DSLAM (at Central office), with DSL modem, and splitter
		- Cable modem with cable (coaxial cable, fiber - so it is also known as Hybrid fiber Coax (HFC)), with CMTS placed sitting at ISP office
		- Fiber To The Home - ONT, Optical Splitter, OLT
	- **Enterprise Access** - Ethernet, Wifi
		- **Ethernet** - LAN that connects end systems to the edge router, with the aid of **Ethernet switch**
	- **Wide area wireless access** - 3G, 4G, 5G
- **Physical media** 
	- Guided media vs unguided media - whether or not the connection is guided along a solid medium, e.g. fiber-optic cable vs Wifi
	- Twisted-pair Copper wire, Coaxial cable, Fiber Optics, Terrestrial Radio Channel, Satellite Radio Channel
